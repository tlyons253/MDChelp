<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>Capture-recapture methods and related concepts are at the foundation
of a plethora of methods and analytic techniques used in ecological. It
can be difficult to know how best to design a study or even what type of
data to collect without first having some kind of an idea of the
analysis you might perform. The goal of these notes is to provide a
<em>very</em> basic overview of what you can do with capture-recapture
methods, the basic data needs and assumptions, and provide some basic
tools to help guide the development of projects. There are many, many
books that cover this topic with much better clarity and detail, but
three that may be helpful in particular are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://larkinpowell.wixsite.com/larkinpowell/estimation-of-parameters-for-animal-pop" class="external-link">Estimation
of Parameters for Animal Populations (Powell and Gale 2015)</a></li>
<li><a href="www.wiley.com/go/MurayPopulationEcology">Population Ecology
in Practice (Murray and Sandercock 2022)</a></li>
<li><a href="www.phidot.org">Program Mark “A Gentle
Introduction”</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These offer more comprehensive discussions of specific types of
models without being overly technical (the first two), though the
“Gentle Introduction” goes into much more discussion about a given
model, while also giving guidance on their implementation in Program
MARK.</p>
<p>This and related articles are meant to be a quick reference, to help
make you aware of what is out there and is in no way comprehensive
enough to be the only resource you use. You should definitely read
relevant sections of these or other books, papers, or consult with one
of the biometricians if you identify a technique you are interested in
using for a project.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="key-terminology-and-concepts">Key Terminology and Concepts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#key-terminology-and-concepts"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are some characteristics/concepts that help
frame/organize/differentiate among the plethora of methods and serve as
the basis of critical assumptions. When looking into more specific
methods or models, you’ll see these terms being referenced
frequently.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="model-assumptions-open-or-closed-populations">Model assumptions: open or closed populations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-assumptions-open-or-closed-populations"></a>
</h3>
<p>Whether a population can be classified as open or closed defines most
capture-recapture methods and is a critical assumption in different
models. Closed is simpler to define, as there are a few different
processes that makes a population “open”. Most simply, a <strong>closed
population</strong> means that, for the time you are observing your
animals, there are no births, deaths, or immigration or emigration of
any kind. The animals you do (or could) observe or capture are the same
individuals and do not change. If births, deaths, or movement into or
out of your study area exist, during your data collection, then you have
an <strong>open population</strong>. It’s an important concept to
understand, but not always black in white in practice. The lines between
“open” and “closed” populations (and related statistical models) blur
because only some processes are relevant to a particular model (deaths
and emigration, Cormack-Jolly-Seber), or because of how you structure
your data collection and define a time frame.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example:</strong> If I go and capture and mark birds in a
field to estimate abundance each year for 5 years, clearly those are not
all the same birds. Between years, or even within a year, birds can be
born, can move into the field, leave the field, or die. However, during
the time I am marking birds in a given year, if <u>none</u> of those
processes occur, then, for the purposes of my data collection and
analysis, I have a closed population. I can then use a model that
assumes I have a closed population to analyze the data from each year.
Thus, depending on what it is you are interested in measuring and how
you design your data collection, you can sometimes treat what is truly
an “open” population as being closed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Example:</strong> The Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model is
considered an “open” population model because you expect individuals to
die and you estimate the apparent survival of individuals between
encounters. It’s called apparent survival because if you also have
individuals leave the study area (emigrate), you can’t differentiate
between deaths and leaving. However, if you <em>can</em> safely assume
that individuals don’t leave, but the population is
<strong>open</strong> (because individuals can still die), then you are
estimating true survival. Movement into the population or births don’t
matter in this instance, because the CJS a model only tries to estimate
apparent survival.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Being able to think about how the concept of open or closed
populations relates to your study organism, question, and data
collection is key as it is the backbone of virtually every statistical
model you will use and acts as an important building block, permitting
you to use more complex models to answer complex questions.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="conditioning-on-initial-capture-or-modeling-the-initial-capture-full-capture-history">Conditioning on initial capture or modeling the initial capture
(full capture history)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conditioning-on-initial-capture-or-modeling-the-initial-capture-full-capture-history"></a>
</h4>
<p>It is less important to understand this in detail at this stage, but
it’s an important technical concept that applies to open-population
models. Conditioning on the initial capture just means you don’t
particularly care about modeling the initial capture of the animal, you
only care about what happens after you have caught and released it.
Methods like Cormack-Jolly-Seber ignore the initial capture process and
only try to estimate apparent survival and <em>re</em>capture
probability. Other models <u><em>do</em></u> try to explicitly model the
initial capture process (e.g. Jolly-Seber, Pradel, POPAN,
closed-capture).</p>
<p>What does each approach get you? By explicitly trying to model the
initial capture, you can also start to estimate parameters like
abundance and population growth rate. When you condition on the initial
capture, you skip all that and only focus on what happens to those
animals afterwards, typically focusing on apparent survival or
movement.</p>
<p>So why not always model the initial capture if it gets you more
information about the animal population? Logistically, it can be
challenging. Modeling the initial capture requires that you are
constantly capturing and marking animals throughout time. It’s not easy
to support that kind of effort and as a result. Full capture history
methods might not work well for studies that only last a few years or
where animals are captured and marked on very few occasions, relative to
how frequently they may be encountered (e.g. waterfowl banding,
translocation studies). You also need to have the method of initial
capture be the same as subsequent encounters. Finally, the estimates for
some parameters (like abundance) might not be that good. In
closed-capture models, there is a lot of focus on dealing with issues
related to heterogeneity in capture probability, whether it’s
trap-response, age/cohort/time differences, etc. That complexity doesn’t
go away, and probably gets worse in open models. You can’t deal with in
open models like you can in closed models (but see “robust design”
models). Still, using the full capture history can allow you to estimate
other parameters (that aren’t as affected by theses issues) that can be
pretty interesting, like <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-condor/volume-116/issue-2/CONDOR-13-114.1/Stopover-ecology-of-American-Golden-Plovers-Pluvialis-dominica-in-Midwestern/10.1650/CONDOR-13-114.1.short" class="external-link">migratory

<h3 id="estimating-abundance-or-demographic-parameters">Estimating abundance or demographic parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#estimating-abundance-or-demographic-parameters"></a>
</h3>
<p>Another way to subdivide these models is whether the goal is to
estimate abundance or demographic parameters (e.g., survival,
recruitment, population growth rate, etc.). There are methods that do
both but this is one of the key ways to differentiate among methods.
There are both open and closed models that can do this as well. Examples
of specific capture-recapture methods that focus on estimating abundance
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lincoln-Petersen (closed)</li>
<li>Jolly-Seber (open)</li>
<li>Closed Capture recapture (closed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Models/ approaches that focus on demographic parameters are by
definition, open models, but may not account for all processes
(immigration/emigration, survival, etc.). Some models that primarily
focus on demographic processes are :</p>
<ul>
<li>Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS)</li>
<li>Jolly Seber</li>
<li>Pradel</li>
<li>Robust Design (combines closed and open processes)</li>
<li>Brownie/Seber (Dead encounters)</li>
</ul>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="unique-or-generic-markings">Unique or generic markings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#unique-or-generic-markings"></a>
</h3>
<p>Not all approaches require you to be able to uniquely identify
individuals. Sometimes the organism is too small to be marked with a
unique tag, such tags are more likely to be lost compared to other
marking techniques (e.g scute marking on turtles, fin clips), or other
animal welfare or logistical concerns prevent unique identification.
However, you generally have more flexibility if you can uniquely
identify individuals. The frequent reality that, for models that use
generic markings, many key assumptions cannot be met has generally led
to most researchers to use individually identifiable markings. Still,
there are cases where generic markings are useful (e.g. estimating
waterfowl abundance from direct band recoveries) and you can always
“anonymize” your uniquely marked organisms for a model that only
requires generic markings.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="art_image/LPschnab.jpg" alt="**Lincoln (L) and Schnabel (R)**" width="50%"><p class="caption">
<strong>Lincoln (L) and Schnabel (R)</strong>
</p>
</div>
<p>The Lincoln-Petersen index and related estimators (e.g. Chao,
Schnabel), Jolly-Seber, and some types of mark-resight models can use
information about generic markings, but they come with relatively more
strict assumptions. All of these approaches have alternatives or
different formulations that utilize unique markings that permit you to
deal with real issues that can cause bias (e.g. capture probability
heterogeneity, non-closure). The upshot is, you can do more and deal
with violations of assumptions more easily with unique markings. Options
still exist for generic marking, and often, some clever sampling design
and help ensure critical model assumptions are met.</p>

</h3>
<p>There is what may seem to be an overwhelming number of
capture-recapture based methods in the literature and clarifying what
discriminates among them and the key assumptions can help sift through
them. Understanding key concepts like population closure is critical not
just to using these models correctly, but is important for other methods
based on capture recapture (e.g. N-mixture models), or adapting these
models to novel applications<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content='&lt;p&gt;Stodola et al. 2014. Stopover ecology of American
