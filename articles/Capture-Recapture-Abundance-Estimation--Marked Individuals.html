</h2>
<p>Below are several common abundance estimation methods suitable for
<strong>closed populations</strong>. Demographic closure means that,
while animals are being observed, there are no births, deaths,
immigration, or emigration within the study area. The methods below are
identified as appropriate for “marked” individuals. That is, these
assume you are physically capturing and marking individuals. Another
document covers abundance estimation in closed populations for
individuals you can uniquely identify, but are physically marking
them.</p>
<p>All these methods are various formulations, with different
assumptions, constraints, and data collection methods, to solving this
equation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ N=\frac{n}{p} \]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of individuals, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of individuals we
observe, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the “encounter”
(capture or recapture) probability. The only thing you need to retain
from this equation is all these methods are trying use different
approaches to estimate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. But if
you are interested in understanding more of the math, there is some
discussion of that as well.</p>

<p><br><br> The original Lincoln-Petersen (LP) estimator (Petersen
1896<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a>,
Lincoln 1930<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a>) is a simple 2-sample technique to estimate
abundance. By 2-sample technique, I mean you only need 2 capture
occasions: the first capture occasion when you mark and release animals,
and an additional occasion when you recapture them. That’s it. The LP
estimator calculates abundance as: <span class="math display">\[N=\frac{n_1\times \ n_2}{k}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> the number of animals
encountered on the first occasion. All encountered animals are marked
and released.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> the
<u><em>total</em></u> number of animals encountered on the second
occasion.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of marked
individuals from <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span>, observed in
<span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very simple equation, but it’s not the one actually used in
practice. If you do end up using a LP, you will most likely use the
Chapman version/ estimator. It’s what’s implemented in
<code><a href="../reference/chapman.html">MDChelp::chapman()</a></code>.</p>
<p>Multiple variations and extensions of the LP method exist. If you
have multiple encounters where you mark, release, and recapture
individuals, an alternative known as the Schnabel method/estimator is
appropriate (after Zoe Emily Schnabel). There are also methods that
combine the Schnabel method with simultaneous removals, but are not
discussed here. The extensions beyond the simple LP framework have
largely been supplanted by methods that use uniquely marked animals,
primarily because of the development of better marking techniques
(e.g. RFID tags). Still, it’s important to highlight the conceptual
contributions of these individuals. It’s also a helpful reminder of some
less common methods that are sill viable, when you can’t meet the data
collection methods of more contemporary alternatives.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The population is closed between the first and second capture
events!!!!</p></li>
<li><p>Tags or markings do not need to be unique among individuals, but
there are no tag losses between the following the release of marked
individuals.</p></li>
<li>
<p>All individuals have the same <u><strong>recapture</strong></u>
probability.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The capture probability at the first event can be different than
the probability at the second event, but the capture probability between
unmarked and marked individuals is the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This means that the methods used to capture individuals during
the first event for marking can be different than those used to capture
individuals during individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most extreme example of this is when the LP method is used to
estimate abundance when the initial capture period is (obviously) a live
capture, marking and release, but the recapture is a dead recovery
(e.g. waterfowl band recovery, tagged fish).</li>

<li><p>Performs poorly when fewer than 50 individuals ( ideally, mark
&gt; 100) or <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is small. This is
important if there is group-level heterogeneity in capture probability.
If capture probability differs between male/ female or adult/juvenile,
you “bin” individuals in each group separately which can lead to small
<span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> for any group</p></li>

<h4 id="why-still-use-it">Why still use it ?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-still-use-it"></a>
</h4>
<p>While “better” methods do exist that deal with some very common
violations of the assumptions that LP relies on (capture heterogeneity),
they typically require you find more populations to sample, have more
capture events, etc. <strong>The fact that the alternatives might be
difficult to implement is not an excuse to just use LP if you cannot
adequately meet the assumptions!!!</strong> It is worth remembering
though, that it can be advantageous to alter your study design to meet
the assumptions of a simpler approach than to address logistical or
animal welfare constraints of methods with more flexible or relaxed
assumptions.</p>

<div class="tab-pane" id="closed-capture-likelihood-models-and-variations" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="closed-capture-likelihood-models-and-variations-tab">

<p>There are times when the LP approach won’t cut it. Usually it’s
because the assumption of a homogeneous encounter probability for marked
and unmarked animals isn’t met. Alternatives to LP (or Scnabel) still
rely on demographic closure assumptions, but can account for
heterogeneous encounter probabilities among individuals and across
encounter events.</p>
<p>Doing so requires some changes. Mathematically, we now start using
likelihood based methods. This just means we start using probability
theory and distributions to estimate abundance rather than algebra like
above. The more practical, real-world implication is, we now need to
have individuals marked with unique markings and we need to follow
them.</p>
<p>There are a lot of variations to using a likelihood based approach
(see Chapter 14 in the Program MARK “Gentle Introduction”) but the first
difference to be aware of is if you are using the “full-likelihood” or
or a “conditional” likelihood. As mentioned
in<code>article("Capture-Recapture-Overview",package="MDChelp"</code>)</p>
