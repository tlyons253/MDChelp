</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the overview, capture-recapture models for closed
populations are strictly used for estimating the abundance of critters.
Though many abundance estimation methods have, at their core, some kind
of closed population capture-recapture framework, these methods below
are generally applied to strictly estimate abundance <span class="math inline">\(\hat{N}\)</span>. There have been limited
applications of these methods beyond obtaining a point estimate for a
location, at a single point in time, and none that robustly address
abundance-habitat relationships, though expanding the model development
to address these questions using Bayesian methods (or spatially explicit
capture-recapture) are possibilities.</p>
<p>Below are several common capture-recapture abundance estimation
methods suitable for <strong>closed populations</strong>, often
shortened as “closed capture methods”. Demographic closure means that,
while animals are being observed, there are no births, deaths,
immigration, or emigration within the study area. The methods below are
appropriate for “marked” individuals. That is, these assume you are
physically capturing and marking individuals. Another document covers
abundance estimation in closed populations for individuals you can
uniquely identify, but are not physically marking them.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, we’re trying to solve this equation: <span class="math display">\[
N=\frac{n}{p}
\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the unknown
abundance,<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of unique
individuals we know about, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
the capture probability.</p>
<p>Probably the most important thing to recognize about these models is,
aside from needing to meet the closure assumption, all methods are
<strong>very, very, sensitive to violations of assumptions about capture
probability and closure</strong>. If capture/recapture probability is
not addressed correctly, your estimates of abundance can be very, very
wrong.</p>
<p>Typically, the use of the methods below will require you have some
form of trap grid or transects (think small mammal traps) or can at
least define some spatial extent you are trapping (e.g., sampling
defined stream reaches, capturing waterfowl within a spatially defined
breeding population). Again, having demographic closure is of key
importance here; if animals are moving in and out of the study area or
the size of the study area keeps changing (due to sampling effort) then
your estimate of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> becomes somewhat
useless.</p>

the basis of banding returns. Circular 118, pp. 1–4. United States
Department of Agriculture,&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a>) is
a simple 2-sample technique to estimate abundance. By 2-sample
technique, I mean you only need 2 capture occasions: the first capture
occasion when you mark and release animals, and an additional occasion
when you recapture them. That’s it. The LP estimator calculates
abundance as: <span class="math display">\[N=\frac{n_1\times \
n_2}{k}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> the number of animals
encountered on the first occasion. All encountered animals are marked
and released.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> the
<u><em>total</em></u> number of animals encountered on the second
occasion.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of marked
individuals from <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span>, captured
again and included in <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very simple equation, but it’s not the one actually used in
practice. If you do end up using a LP, you will most likely use the
Chapman version/ estimator. It’s what’s implemented in
<code><a href="../reference/chapman.html">MDChelp::chapman()</a></code>.</p>
<p>Multiple variations and extensions of the LP method exist. If you
have multiple encounters where you mark, release, and recapture
individuals, an alternative known as the Schnabel method/estimator is
appropriate (after Zoe Emily Schnabel). There are also methods that
combine the Schnabel method with simultaneous removals, but are not
discussed here and aren’t generally used anymore. The extensions beyond
the simple LP framework have largely been supplanted by methods that use
uniquely marked animals, primarily because of the development of better
marking techniques (e.g. RFID tags). Still, it’s important to highlight
the conceptual contributions of these individuals. It’s also a helpful
reminder of some less common methods that are sill viable when you can’t
meet the data collection needs of more contemporary alternatives.</p>

</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The population is closed between the first and second capture
events!!!!</p></li>
<li><p>Tags or markings do not need to be unique among individuals, but
there are no tag losses between the following the release of marked
individuals.</p></li>
<li>
<p>All individuals have the same <u><strong>recapture</strong></u>
probability.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The capture probability at the first event can be different than
the probability at the second event, but the capture probability between
unmarked and marked individuals is the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This means that the methods used to capture individuals during
the first event for marking can be different than those used to capture
individuals during the second event.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most extreme example of this is when the LP method is used to
estimate abundance when the initial capture period is (obviously) a live
capture, marking and release, but the recapture is a dead recovery
(e.g. waterfowl band recovery, tagged fish).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>LP methods perform poorly when fewer than 50 individuals are
marked ( ideally, mark &gt; 100) or <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is small. This is important if there is
group-level heterogeneity in capture probability. If capture probability
differs between male/ female or adult/juvenile, you “bin” individuals in
each group separately which can lead to small <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> for any group</p></li>

<h4 id="why-still-use-it">Why still use it ?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-still-use-it"></a>
</h4>
<p>While “better” methods do exist that deal with some very common
violations of the assumptions that LP relies on (capture heterogeneity),
they typically require you find more populations to sample, have more
capture events, etc. <strong>The fact that the alternatives might be
difficult to implement is not an excuse to just use LP if you cannot
adequately meet the assumptions!!!</strong> It is worth remembering
though, that it can be advantageous to alter your study design to meet
the assumptions of a simpler approach than to address logistical or
animal welfare constraints of methods that promise more flexible or
relaxed assumptions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane" id="closed-capture-likelihood-models-and-variations" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="closed-capture-likelihood-models-and-variations-tab">

<p>There are times when the LP or other simpler approaches won’t cut it.
Usually it’s because the assumption of a homogeneous encounter
probability for marked and unmarked animals isn’t met. If you cannot
meet that assumption, then it’s time to switch to a likelihood approach
that can!</p>
<p>Doing so requires some changes. Mathematically, we now start using
likelihood based methods. This just means we start using probability
theory and distributions to estimate abundance rather than algebra like
above. The more practical, real-world implication is, we now need to
have individuals marked with unique markings and we need to follow them.
You are likely going to also have &gt; 2 encounter events, or
opportunities to capture and recapture marked animals. Information about
whether an individual(s) was captured at each encounter event is called
an encounter history. We now have several parameters that get used to
describe these encounter or capture histories.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{N}\)</span> the estimated
abundance</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> the capture and/or recapture
probability.</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> the recapture probability, if
different from <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not the only parameters you may come across if you end up
getting further into closed-capture models, but they’re the foundation
on what all other variations are built and what can be used to help
discriminate among the different variations.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="variations-on-closed-capture-models">Variations on closed-capture models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#variations-on-closed-capture-models"></a>
</h4>
<p>A big focus of the historical development around closed-capture
models is to account for capture heterogeneity. This has led to a host
of variations in the literature. Below are some more common variations
in closed capture models that might help clarify things if you get more
into these methods, but also represent some important practical issues
you should consider with your own data. Unless noted, these variations
exist for both full-likelihood and Huggins methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Behavioral response to trapping:</strong> Use <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> to account for trap happiness or trap
shyness</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Temporal variation in capture probability:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and/or <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> varies among encounter events</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heterogeneity via “mixtures”:</strong> There are groups
of individuals with different <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, but you can’t identify them in
the field. We can use a “mixture model” that introduces another
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> that represents the
probability an individual belongs to one unobservable group or the
other. Groups have different <span class="math inline">\(p/c\)</span>
parameters, but individuals within groups are assumed
homogeneous.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heterogeneity as individual random effects:</strong> Is
only feasible with the Huggins model. Rather than grouping individuals,
or assuming individuals within groups are homogeneous, we can treat all
critters as being different from one another via an individual random
effect. Like random effects in linear models, there is some “average”
<span class="math inline">\(p/c\)</span> but individuals deviate from
this average. Those deviations follow a normal distribution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These variations are an important extension. As mentioned before,
estimates of abundance are sensitive to assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(p/c\)</span>, whether they are the same among
individuals, vary among individuals, vary across capture events, etc.
Appropriately accounting for these possibilities is critical to
obtaining accurate and unbiased estimates of abundance.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="criticisims-complications">Criticisims/ Complications<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#criticisims-complications"></a>
</h4>
<p>There are a few common criticisms or complications that arise with
the use of likelihood-based closed-capture methods</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is only an estimate of the
population size vulnerable to capture. If you sample more area
(intentionally or unintentionally), your estimate of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> increases. Other methods focus on
estimating density try to address this problem (e.g. spatially-explicit
capture-recapture; SECR).</p></li>
<li><p>Most applications do not try to address or estimate what causes
variation in <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-it’s possible, but
likely logistically challenging (trapping effort in multiple areas) and
still suffers from the above issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of this, it’s typically suggested to use a SECR approach
if possible. It results in an exactly defined spatial extent, making
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> more reliable and can more easily
incorporate/ test for environmental variables affecting
abundance.</p></li>
<li><p>Other methods have you sample smaller, but still defined areas to
estimate density in a model-based approach. It’s much simpler to
incorporate information about</p></li>
<li><p>If you can exactly define the extent of the space being sampled,
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> represents a
<strong>realized</strong> estimate of abundance, that is the estimate of
the number of critters actually running around at that time. Other
methods may provide model-based estimates of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> or both. Model-based estimates provide
the expected abundance, given information about things like habitat or
other environmental covariates. These are not the same quantity and
which one you should use will depend on your question.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="tab-pane" id="summary" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="summary-tab">

<p>The above covers more the the technical details of closed-capture
methods. It’s important to understand them and they cannot be ignored.
But if you are in the processing of identifying appropriate methods for
your particular question, below are some general, practical points about
closed-capture methods that may be helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The closed capture methods described above are best suited when
getting an estimate of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is of
interest, not understanding various factors responsible for variation in
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of many of the strict assumptions, it’s probably best not
to think of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> as a “true” estimate
of abundance, unless you can guarantee all individuals are vulnerable to
capture. If you can at least ensure a representative sample, it provides
a very good index.</p></li>
<li><p>In practice, the best uses of these methods independently
(e.g. not part of a robust design or other integrated method) will
probably be for simple monitoring and status and trend
assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>Some specifics like distinction between <span class="math inline">\(p/c\)</span> are specific to physically capturing
animals, but conceptually, but closed-capture methods are a very general
concept that most other capture-recapture methods are based on.</p></li>
