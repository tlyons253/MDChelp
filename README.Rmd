# MDChelp

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MDChelp is to provide functions and demonstrations of common statistical methods in fish/ wildlife research.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MDChelp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

options(download.file.method = "wininet")
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tlyons253/MDChelp")
```

See "Articles" in the menu for a list of potentially helpful articles on methods and techniques. If there is a topic you are interested in, or an analysis you do frequently, let me know and I can develop articles or functions to include in the `MDChelp` package.
